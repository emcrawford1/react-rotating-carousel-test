/* Will need to calculate the rotation of each carousel item based on how many items exist.  
   We will attempt to do this by:
    1) Passing in the carouselItems array (metadata is in the index 0; data starts in index 1)
    2) Calculate the number of items in the carouselItems array
    3) Determine how much the container object will need to rotate to display the next item
    4) Determine how much each item will need to counter-rotate to continue facing the user
    5) Add these amounts to each carousel item.
    6) Return the carouselItems array
